ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS.\\n\\nQ5: Who is the Immigration Judge?\\nA5: The Immigration Judge is the person who will decide your case.

That asylum officer will decide if you can apply for asylum and which process applies to you.\\n\\nQ4: What are the two different processes that may apply to an individual seeking asylum?\\nA4: The two different processes that may apply are the credible fear process and the reasonable fear process.\\n\\nQ5: When does the credible fear process apply?\\nA5: The credible fear process applies if you have recently come to the United States without permission.\\n\\nQ6: When does the reasonable fear process apply?\\nA6: The reasonable fear process applies if you have been deported before, have a prior deportation order, or have been convicted of an aggravated felony and are not a lawful permanent resident.\\n\\nQ7: How are the credible fear and reasonable fear processes different from the regular deportation process?\\nA7: The credible fear and reasonable fear processes are different from the regular deportation process in that they involve different criteria and procedures for determining whether an individual can apply for asylum.\\n\\nQ8: Where can you find more detailed information about asylum?\\nA8: More detailed information about asylum can be found in the Florence Project’s booklet, \"I’m Afraid to Go Back: A Guide to Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and the Convention Against Torture\". It can be accessed at https://firrp.org/resources/prose/.Q1: What right does a person have in terms of seeking protection from persecution or torture in their home country?\\nA1: By law, a person has the right to ask the United States to protect them from persecution or torture in their home country.\\n\\nQ2: Does this right guarantee that the government must let the person stay in the United States or that it cannot deport them?\\nA2: No, this right is only to ask for protection. It does not necessarily mean that the government must let the person stay in the United States or that it cannot deport them.\\n\\nQ3: What happens if a person expresses fear of being deported to their home country to an immigration officer or judge?\\nA3: If a person expresses fear of being deported to their home country, they must have the chance to tell an asylum officer their story. This is part of exercising their right to seek protection and to start the credible fear or reasonable fear process.\\n\\nQ4: What is the possible outcome of expressing fear and starting the credible fear or reasonable fear process?\\nA4: By expressing fear and starting the credible fear or reasonable fear process, a person may then be able to apply for asylum.Q1: What is the Credible Fear Process in immigration law?\\nA1: The Credible Fear Process applies to individuals who do not have a prior order of deportation, have not been convicted of an aggravated felony, have expressed fear, and have not been before an immigration judge. Within 10 days of expressing fear, they should have an interview with an asylum officer who will decide if they have shown a \"credible fear\" of being deported, or if a \"significant possibility\" exists that they could win a case for asylum before a judge.\\n\\nQ2: What is the Reasonable Fear Process in immigration law?\\nA2: The Reasonable Fear Process applies to individuals who have been deported before, have an in absentia order of deportation, or have been convicted of committing an aggravated felony. During the reasonable fear interview, the asylum officer will decide if the individual has shown a \"reasonable possibility\" that they will be persecuted or tortured if they are deported.\\n\\nQ3: What is the difference between the Credible Fear Process and the Reasonable Fear Process?\\nA3: The main difference between the two processes is the individuals they apply to. The Credible Fear Process applies to those without a prior deportation order and no aggravated felony conviction, while the Reasonable Fear Process applies to those who have been deported before, have an in absentia order of deportation, or have been convicted of an aggravated felony.\\n\\nQ4: What is the waiting time for an interview in the Credible Fear Process?\\nA4: Within 10 days of expressing fear, an individual should have an interview with an asylum officer. However, in practice, especially in places like Arizona, the wait time may be longer.\\n\\nQ5: What is the waiting time for an interview in the Reasonable Fear Process?\\nA5: The waiting time for an interview in the Reasonable Fear Process is typically longer than in the Credible Fear Process. In Arizona, for example, some people have waited 6 months to 12 months for their reasonable fear interviews.Q1: What are your rights if you decide not to wait for your asylum interview?\\nA1: You have the absolute right to not wait for your asylum interview. If you decide to leave detention, you should contact your deportation officer and state that you no longer wish to wait for an interview and that you will accept deportation or voluntary departure if available.\\n\\nQ2: What are the potential consequences of deciding not to wait for your asylum interview?\\nA2: If you decide to leave detention, it might be much harder or even impossible to apply for asylum later. Your level of proof will be higher in the future and the government attorney might argue that you were not really afraid because you chose to go back to your country.\\n\\nQ3: How can you prepare for your asylum interview?\\nA3: Preparing for your interview will help make your case stronger. It is normal to feel nervous or scared about the process. If you need an interpreter for the interview, tell the asylum officer right away. If a problem with the interpreter arises or you do not understand each other well, tell the officer immediately.\\n\\nQ4: What should you do if the interpreter makes a mistake during your asylum interview?\\nA4: If the interpreter does not translate properly and the officer assumes that you caused the mistakes or errors, you should correct it immediately. Since the officer decides if your case goes before a judge, it is especially important that you make a correction if it sounds like they misunderstood what you said.Q1: What is the main focus of the questions asked by the asylum officer?\\nA1: The main focus of the questions asked by the asylum officer is on your fear and why you are afraid to go back to your country.\\n\\nQ2: What is not a valid reason for seeking asylum?\\nA2: Simply showing that you are a good person and that you came to the United States to work and support your family is not a valid reason for seeking asylum.\\n\\nQ3: What are some of the things the officer will want to know in your interview?\\nA3: The officer will want to know who harmed, persecuted, or tortured you (or will they do so in the future), why they did it, and if the reason was something about you in particular such as your race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or your membership in a group (your sexual orientation, gender, disability).\\n\\nQ4: What should you do if you are unsure or do not know an answer to a question asked by the asylum officer?\\nA4: If you are unsure or do not know an answer to a question asked by the asylum officer, you should tell the officer that you are not sure or do not know the answer.\\n\\nQ5: What is the consequence of lying to the asylum officer?\\nA5: Lying to the asylum officer will make things worse.Q1: What should you be specific about when explaining why you were harmed?\\nA1: You should be specific about why you were harmed due to your political ideas. You should explain precisely how you know that, for example, if the person who hurt you said something that told you about their reason, or if the person was wearing clothing or had a hairstyle that let you know.\\n\\nQ2: What should you consider about the government\\'s involvement in your persecution?\\nA2: You should consider how the government in your country was involved. If the government itself did not harm, persecute, or torture you, what did the government of your country – including the police – try to do about it? You should be able to prove that the government of your country, including the local authorities, were either unwilling or unable to protect you.\\n\\nQ3: What should you be able to show if you tried to go somewhere else in your country?\\nA3: You should be able to show that if you tried to go somewhere else in your country, the people who harmed you (or who want to harm you) are still there and still want to harm you, the people who will harm you will find you wherever you go, or it would be unreasonable for you to go anywhere else, maybe because you would be at great risk of harm in general.\\n\\nQ4: What happens after your interview for asylum?\\nA4: In the days after your interview, the asylum officer will decide if your fear is credible or reasonable and if you should be able to apply for asylum before the immigration judge. The officer will write a summary of what you said in the interview and send it to you with the decision.Q1: What happens in a reasonable fear interview for people who have been deported before or have an aggravated felony?\\nA1: In a reasonable fear interview, the asylum officer will summarize the facts of the interview and will usually ask if the summary is accurate. It is important to correct any inaccuracies in the written summary.\\n\\nQ2: What does it mean if you pass your interview?\\nA2: If you pass your interview, it does not mean that you have won your case. It only means that you will have the opportunity to see an immigration judge to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or Convention Against Torture protection and tell your story.\\n\\nQ3: What can you do if you do not pass your interview?\\nA3: If you do not pass your interview, you can ask the immigration judge to review the asylum officer’s decision. However, it is generally very difficult to get these decisions overturned.\\n\\nQ4: What should you prepare for if you do not pass your interview?\\nA4: If you do not pass your interview, you should prepare for the possibility that you will probably be deported.\\n\\nQ5: What is possible in the 9th Circuit if you do not pass your interview?\\nA5: In the 9th Circuit, it is possible to obtain review of the immigration judge’s decision through a Petition for Review. If you would like to do this, you should immediately contact an attorney for advice and assistance.'"
