The case of Prudencio v. Holder, 669 F.3d 472 (2012) involves Ricardo A. Prudencio, a lawful permanent resident of the United States originally from El Salvador, who was convicted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor after having sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against him under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), arguing that his conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) used the three-step procedural framework established by the Attorney General in Matter of Silva–Trevino to make this determination.

However, Prudencio appealed this decision, arguing against the use of Silva-Trevino's approach and insisting on using categorical and modified categorical approaches instead. He contended that under these approaches, his conviction could not be classified as such a crime. The court agreed with Prudencio's argument and ruled that only an alien's prior conviction should be considered when determining whether it qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude, not any conduct underlying that conviction.

The court also disagreed with DHS's assertion that immigration judges should have discretion to consider evidence beyond charging papers and judgment in order to determine if an alien was "convicted" of a "crime involving moral turpitude." Instead, they argued for strict adherence to Shepard/Taylor categorical and modified categorical approaches which prohibit immigration judges from looking at evidence beyond the record of conviction.

In conclusion, due to lack sufficient information in Prudencio’s record of conviction regarding which subsection he violated under Virginia’s delinquency statute, DHS failed to meet its burden proving that his offense involved moral turpitude. Therefore, his petition was granted and both BIA’s decision and removal order were vacated.

- Procedural history:

    - An immigration judge uses Silva-Trevino's approach to sustain removal charge.
    - BIA dismisses Prudencio's appeal.
    - Court applies Shepard/Taylor categorical approach rather than deferring to Silva-Trevino.
    - Court grants Prudencio's petition for review; vacates immigration judge's order; enters final judgment in favor of him.
- Law enforcement reports:
    - A narrative report prepared by Prince William County Police Department relating to Prudencio’s 2010 conviction was admitted during initial proceedings but later rejected by court as part of record for consideration.
    - Other documents introduced include police incident report related to original charge on warrant superseded by amended charge under delinquency statute; however court did not assign weight or importance since it ruled original charge irrelevant due its supersession by amended one.

Summary: 
The case of Prudencio v. Holder, 669 F.3d 472 (2012) involves Ricardo A. Prudencio, a lawful permanent resident of the United States originally from El Salvador. Prudencio petitioned for a review of an order from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that classified him as an alien subject to removal due to an alleged conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. The United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, ruled in favor of Prudencio. The court held that the language of the applicable statute was not ambiguous, the statute was not silent regarding the process for determining whether a particular conviction qualified as one involving moral turpitude, and Prudencio's offense of conviction was not a crime involving moral turpitude. As a result, the petition was granted and the removal order was vacated.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's petition for review of the BIA's order that classified him as an alien subject to removal based on an alleged conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, which ruled in favor of Prudencio.

Summary: 
The case of Prudencio v. Holder, 669 F.3d 472 (2012) continues with Ricardo A. Prudencio, a lawful permanent resident of the United States from El Salvador, petitioning for a review of a decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). The BIA had dismissed his appeal from an immigration judge's decision that classified him as an alien subject to removal under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), due to a previous conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude. The immigration judge used a three-step procedural framework established by the Attorney General in Matter of Silva–Trevino to make this determination. The court concluded that the moral turpitude provisions of the INA are not ambiguous and do not require agency clarification, thus the procedural framework established in Silva–Trevino was not an authorized exercise of the Attorney General's authority. Therefore, Prudencio's petition was granted and the BIA's decision and the order for Prudencio's removal were vacated.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's petition for review of the BIA's decision, which dismissed his appeal from an immigration judge's decision that classified him as an alien subject to removal due to a previous conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.

Summary: 
In June 2010, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated removal proceedings against Ricardo A. Prudencio under 8 U.S.C.§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), arguing that he was subject to removal due to a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of his admission into the United States. The immigration judge used the three-step procedural framework established in Silva–Trevino to determine if Prudencio's conviction under the delinquency statute inherently involved moral turpitude. The judge concluded that the statute was divisible, encompassing some crimes that involve moral turpitude and others that do not. The judge then reviewed Prudencio's record of conviction and, finding it inconclusive, proceeded to the third step of the Silva–Trevino framework. The judge reviewed a narrative report prepared by the Prince William County Police Department relating to the 2010 conviction, which indicated that Prudencio had sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl when he was over the age of 18. Based on this information, the judge sustained the removal charge and ordered that Prudencio be removed to El Salvador. Prudencio appealed the order of removability to the Board, challenging the procedural framework established in Silva–Trevino and contending that the documents reviewed by the immigration judge conclusively established that he was convicted under a subsection of the delinquency statute that does not encompass crimes involving moral turpitude. The Board dismissed his appeal.

- The procedural history of the case includes the DHS initiating removal proceedings against Prudencio in June 2010, the immigration judge's decision to sustain the removal charge and order Prudencio's removal to El Salvador, and Prudencio's appeal to the Board, which was dismissed.
- A narrative report prepared by the Prince William County Police Department relating to Prudencio's 2010 conviction was admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court assigned significant weight to this report, as it was used to sustain the removal charge against Prudencio.
Page 3
Summary: 
Prudencio appealed, arguing against the use of the Silva-Trevino procedural framework and insisting that the categorical and modified categorical approaches should be used to determine if his conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude. He contended that under these approaches, his conviction could not be classified as such a crime. The Silva-Trevino procedural framework was established by the Attorney General in a case involving Cristoval Silva-Trevino, who was convicted of "indecency with a child" in Texas. The DHS initiated removal proceedings against Silva-Trevino, arguing that his conviction was an aggravated felony. The immigration court agreed, but the Board reversed this decision. The Attorney General then established a three-step procedural framework for determining if an alien's conviction qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. This framework begins with a categorical approach, but if there is a "realistic probability" that the statute could be applied to conduct that does not involve moral turpitude, the inquiry must continue to a second step of analysis.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's appeal against the use of the Silva-Trevino procedural framework, the DHS initiating removal proceedings against Silva-Trevino, the immigration court's decision that Silva-Trevino's conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude, the Board's reversal of this decision, and the Attorney General's establishment of a three-step procedural framework for determining if an alien's conviction qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings.

Summary: 
The second step of the Silva-Trevino procedural framework, as described in Prudencio v. Holder, involves the modified categorical approach approved by the Supreme Court in Taylor and Shepard. Here, the immigration judge reviews the record of conviction to determine if the alien's conviction qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. If the documents reviewed do not conclusively resolve the inquiry, the judge should proceed to a third step. This third step, which deviates significantly from the categorical and modified categorical approaches, allows immigration judges to consider evidence beyond the record of conviction if necessary and appropriate. The Attorney General did not provide specific guidance on the type of evidence that may be considered under this third step. The Attorney General established this three-step procedural framework based on his determination that the use of the phrase “moral turpitude” in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is ambiguous. Prudencio challenged the basis for the Attorney General's invocation of his authority, opposing an agency determination reached through adjudication. The court used the Chevron analysis to review the Attorney General's analysis and the procedural framework established in Silva-Trevino.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's challenge to the basis for the Attorney General's invocation of his authority and the court's use of the Chevron analysis to review the Attorney General's analysis and the procedural framework established in Silva-Trevino.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings. However, it does mention that under the third step of the Silva-Trevino procedural framework, immigration judges are authorized to consider evidence beyond the record of conviction if necessary and appropriate. The weight or importance assigned to such evidence is not specified.

Summary: 
The court in Prudencio v. Holder, 669 F.3d 472 (2012) discussed the interpretation of the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The court noted that it had previously accorded substantial deference to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers, using the Chevron framework. However, the court clarified that the issue in this case was not what conduct qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude, but rather what language in the moral turpitude statute informs an adjudicator of the procedure for determining whether a particular conviction qualifies as such a crime. The court distinguished between these two concepts and stated that they require distinct inquiries. The court then analyzed the language of the moral turpitude statute under the Chevron framework to determine whether the statutory language is ambiguous or silent regarding the appropriate procedure for determining whether a particular conviction involves moral turpitude. The court identified three distinct provisions in the moral turpitude statute that are relevant to this case, falling into two separate categories: a category involving convictions and a category involving admissions.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's interpretation of the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" under the INA, its distinction between the concepts of what conduct qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude and what language in the moral turpitude statute informs an adjudicator of the procedure for determining whether a particular conviction qualifies as such a crime, and its analysis of the language of the moral turpitude statute under the Chevron framework.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court's analysis focused on the interpretation of the moral turpitude statute, not on the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction.
Page 6
Summary: 
In Prudencio v. Holder, the court disagreed with the Attorney General's interpretation of the term "involving" in the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The court argued that the term "involving" should not be interpreted in isolation, but rather in its statutory context as part of the unitary phrase "crime involving moral turpitude," a term of art that predates the INA. The court also refuted the Attorney General's assertion that the term "involving" allows for an inquiry into the specific facts underlying a conviction. Instead, the court concluded that the focus of the statutory inquiry is on the actual conviction, not the conduct underlying that conviction. The court further argued that the term "conviction" in the moral turpitude statute should not be given a different meaning in the context of immigration law than in criminal law. The court concluded that the moral turpitude statute is not ambiguous and that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is only authorized to fill a gap in the statutory scheme if the statute is silent regarding the process for determining whether a particular conviction qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's disagreement with the Attorney General's interpretation of the term "involving" in the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" under the INA, its argument that the term should be interpreted in its statutory context, its refutation of the Attorney General's assertion that the term allows for an inquiry into the specific facts underlying a conviction, and its conclusion that the moral turpitude statute is not ambiguous.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court's analysis focused on the interpretation of the moral turpitude statute, not on the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction.
Page 7
Summary: 
In Prudencio v. Holder, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued that the term "moral turpitude" is not usually an element of an offense and thus will not appear in the record of conviction. Therefore, DHS asserted that a circumstance-specific inquiry is permissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). However, the court disagreed, stating that courts have been able to interpret the phrase "moral turpitude" for over a century and that DHS retains the authority to classify various types of offenses as "crimes involving moral turpitude," making fact-specific inquiries unnecessary. The court also disagreed with DHS's argument that the Supreme Court's holding in Nijhawan v. Holder supports the use of a circumstance-specific analysis in applying the INA. The court concluded that the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" is not modified by any other statutory directive and that DHS's request to consider mere factual allegations made in the underlying criminal case cannot be reconciled with the statutory directives established by Congress in the INA.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's disagreement with DHS's argument that a circumstance-specific inquiry is permissible under the INA and its conclusion that the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" is not modified by any other statutory directive.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court's analysis focused on the interpretation of the moral turpitude statute, not on the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction. The court did mention that the third step of the Silva–Trevino framework allows an immigration judge to rely on documents of questionable veracity as "proof" of an alien's conduct, such as police reports and warrant applications, but it did not indicate that such documents were used in this case.
Page 8
Summary: 
In Prudencio v. Holder, the court further elaborates on its disagreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding the use of a factual approach in immigration removal proceedings. The court argues that such an approach, which would consider facts only alleged but not necessarily proved in the underlying criminal proceedings, presents practical difficulties and potential unfairness. The court concludes that the moral turpitude statute is explicit in directing that only the alien's prior conviction, not the conduct underlying that conviction, may be considered. The court also rejects the Attorney General's establishment of a three-step procedural framework for determining whether a conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude. The court's decision aligns with those of the Third, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits. The court then applies the categorical approach to determine whether Prudencio's conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude, examining the statutory elements of the crime rather than the facts or conduct of the particular violation.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's rejection of the Attorney General's three-step procedural framework for determining whether a conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude, and its application of the categorical approach to determine whether Prudencio's conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude.
- The text does not mention any law enforcement reports being admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court's analysis focused on the interpretation of the moral turpitude statute and the application of the categorical approach, not on the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction. The court did not assign any weight or importance to law enforcement reports.
Page 9
Summary: 
In Prudencio v. Holder, the court examines the nature of the delinquency statute under which Prudencio was convicted. The court acknowledges that subsection (ii) of the statute, which criminalizes consensual sexual intercourse with a minor by an adult, is considered a crime involving moral turpitude. However, the court also notes that the delinquency statute includes behaviors that do not qualify as crimes involving moral turpitude. Therefore, the court decides to apply the modified categorical approach to further determine whether Prudencio's conviction involved moral turpitude. Under this approach, the court reviews the record of conviction, which includes the charging document, plea agreement, plea colloquy, and any explicit findings of fact by the trial judge. The court finds that the record of conviction does not provide sufficient information to determine under which subsection of the delinquency statute Prudencio was convicted. The court also rejects the Department of Homeland Security's claim that Prudencio conceded to being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's application of the modified categorical approach to determine whether Prudencio's conviction involved moral turpitude. The court reviewed the record of conviction and found it insufficient to determine under which subsection of the delinquency statute Prudencio was convicted.
- A police report indicating that Prudencio engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with a minor was mentioned, but the court ruled that it could not be considered as part of the record of conviction. Therefore, while a law enforcement report was present, it was not admitted during the immigration proceedings. The court did not assign any weight or importance to this report.
Page 10
Summary: 
In the conclusion of Prudencio v. Holder, the court rules that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not met its burden of proving that Prudencio's 2010 conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude. The court grants Prudencio's petition, vacates the immigration judge's order of removal, and enters final judgment in favor of Prudencio. The court also states that Prudencio's original charge is irrelevant as it was superseded by the amended charge under the delinquency statute. However, a dissenting judge argues against the majority's use of the categorical approach, suggesting that it is not required in the immigration context. Instead, the dissenting judge would defer to the Attorney General's position in Matter of Silva–Trevino, using the Chevron analysis, which counsels deference to the Attorney General's interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's decision to grant Prudencio's petition, vacate the immigration judge's order of removal, and enter final judgment in favor of Prudencio. The court also ruled that Prudencio's original charge was irrelevant as it was superseded by the amended charge under the delinquency statute.
- No new law enforcement reports were admitted during these proceedings. The court did not assign any weight or importance to the original charge on the warrant, which was superseded by the amended charge under the delinquency statute.

Summary: 
Ricardo Prudencio, a legal permanent resident, was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after having sexual relations with a 13-year-old girl. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) determined that Prudencio's conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude, which could lead to his removal. The BIA used the approach from Matter of Silva-Trevino, which allows immigration judges to consider evidence beyond the record of conviction in certain circumstances. However, the majority of the court decided to apply the "categorical approach" from Shepard v. United States and Taylor v. United States, which prohibits immigration judges from looking at evidence beyond the record of conviction. The majority did not defer to Silva-Trevino. A dissenting judge disagreed with the majority, arguing that immigration judges should have the discretion to consider evidence beyond the charging papers and judgment of conviction.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the BIA's determination that this was a crime involving moral turpitude, and the court's decision to apply the "categorical approach" rather than deferring to Silva-Trevino.
- No specific law enforcement reports were mentioned as being admitted during these proceedings. The court's decision was based on the record of conviction and the interpretation of whether Prudencio's crime involved moral turpitude. The dissenting judge argued for the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction, but it is not clear if this would include law enforcement reports.
Page 12
Summary: 
The text discusses the interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act's (INA) moral turpitude provisions, particularly in relation to the case of Ricardo Prudencio. The Attorney General's approach in Silva-Trevino is highlighted, which provides a three-step test for determining whether an alien's prior offense involves moral turpitude. The first two steps align with the Shepard/Taylor categorical and modified categorical approaches, while the third step allows immigration judges to consider additional evidence if necessary. The majority of the court, however, believes that the term "convicted" unambiguously requires the categorical approach. A dissenting opinion argues that the statute is silent on what approach should be used, and thus, the Attorney General's opinion in Silva-Trevino should be deferred to.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the BIA's determination that this was a crime involving moral turpitude, and the court's decision to apply the "categorical approach" rather than deferring to Silva-Trevino. This text fragment adds the detail of the three-step test proposed in Silva-Trevino for determining whether a crime involves moral turpitude.
- No specific law enforcement reports were mentioned as being admitted during these proceedings. The court's decision was based on the record of conviction and the interpretation of whether Prudencio's crime involved moral turpitude. The dissenting judge argued for the consideration of evidence beyond the record of conviction, but it is not clear if this would include law enforcement reports. The Silva-Trevino approach would allow for additional evidence to be considered if the first two steps of the test do not provide a definitive answer.
Page 13
Summary: 
The text fragment discusses the dissenting opinion in the case of Prudencio v. Holder, arguing against the use of the categorical approach in immigration proceedings. The dissenting opinion argues that the bases for Shepard and Taylor, which are criminal cases, are not applicable in the immigration context. The dissenting opinion also cites the Supreme Court case Nijhawan, which required a "circumstance-specific" approach rather than the categorical approach. The dissenting opinion argues that the term "convicted" does not necessarily require the categorical approach and that the moral turpitude provisions do not have an analogue in federal or state criminal statutes. The dissenting opinion concludes that immigration judges should have the discretion to consider evidence beyond the charging papers and judgment.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the BIA's determination that this was a crime involving moral turpitude, and the court's decision to apply the "categorical approach" rather than deferring to Silva-Trevino. This text fragment adds the dissenting opinion's argument against the use of the categorical approach in immigration proceedings.
- No specific law enforcement reports were mentioned as being admitted during these proceedings. The dissenting opinion argues for the consideration of evidence beyond the charging papers and judgment, but it is not clear if this would include law enforcement reports. The dissenting opinion does not specify how much weight or importance should be assigned to such reports if they were to be considered.
Page 14
Summary: 
The text fragment presents a dissenting opinion in the case of Prudencio v. Holder, arguing for the application of the Attorney General's approach in Silva-Trevino. The dissenting judge would deny Prudencio's petition for review, based on his guilty plea to one count of violating Va.Code Ann. § 18.2–371. The judge argues that the term "convicted" does not necessitate strict adherence to the categorical approach, especially in cases not related to the Armed Career Criminal Act or those not listing a "generic" offense. The judge believes that the statute is silent on the procedures an immigration judge may use to determine if an alien was "convicted" of a "crime involving moral turpitude," and thus, defers to the Attorney General's approach in Silva-Trevino. The judge criticizes the majority for dictating how immigration judges may use their administrative resources, which could result in immigrants with convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude remaining in the country.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's guilty plea to one count of violating Va.Code Ann. § 18.2–371, the introduction of evidence to prove Prudencio's conviction, and the dissenting judge's argument for the application of Silva-Trevino's approach. This text fragment adds the dissenting judge's criticism of the majority's interpretation of the term "convicted" and the categorical approach.
- Law enforcement reports were admitted during these proceedings. Specifically, the police incident report, the warrant for carnal knowledge, without force, of a 13-year-old child, and the court form showing Prudencio's guilty plea to contributing to the delinquency of a minor were introduced as evidence. The dissenting judge assigns significant weight to these reports, particularly the police incident report, which serves as proof that Prudencio was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.
Page 15
Summary: 
The text fragment provides additional context to the case of Prudencio v. Holder. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initially asserted two other bases for Prudencio's removal, which were later withdrawn. DHS also charged Prudencio with a violation of section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which the immigration judge did not address and is not under consideration in this appeal. The text also discusses the Attorney General's procedural framework in Silva-Trevino, which is relevant to this case. The Attorney General's approach is criticized for its potential to create confusion and circuit splits. The text also mentions the application of the categorical approach in immigration proceedings, which has been a long-standing practice. However, the Attorney General's approach is seen as a deviation from this tradition.

- The procedural history of the case includes Prudencio's guilty plea, the introduction of evidence to prove his conviction, the dissenting judge's argument for the application of Silva-Trevino's approach, and DHS's initial charges against Prudencio, which were later withdrawn. This text fragment adds the fact that the immigration judge did not address the alleged violation of section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the INA.
- The text does not provide new information about the admission of law enforcement reports during the immigration proceedings. The previous summary mentioned the introduction of a police incident report, a warrant for carnal knowledge, and a court form showing Prudencio's guilty plea as evidence. The weight assigned to these reports remains significant, as they serve as proof of Prudencio's conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.
Page 16
Summary: 
The new text fragment continues the discussion on the case of Prudencio v. Holder, focusing on the interpretation of the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" and the practical implications of the majority's approach. The text criticizes the majority's conclusion that the term "involving" does not create ambiguity in the statute, arguing that the phrase "crime involving moral turpitude" is not a term of art with a settled significance. The text also argues against the majority's suggestion that federal and state criminal prosecutors should ensure that certain materials necessary for a potential future civil proceeding are included in the record of conviction. Instead, it advocates for deferring to reasonable agency procedures to find this needed information.

- The procedural history of the case remains the same as previously summarized. This text fragment does not add new information about the criminal or immigration-related proceedings in the case of Prudencio v. Holder.
- The text does not provide new information about the admission of law enforcement reports during the immigration proceedings. The previous summaries mentioned the introduction of a police incident report, a warrant for carnal knowledge, and a court form showing Prudencio's guilty plea as evidence. The weight assigned to these reports remains significant, as they serve as proof of Prudencio's conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.
