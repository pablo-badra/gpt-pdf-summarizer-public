"
Q5: What is the difference between withholding of removal and asylum?,"A5: Both are forms of relief from deportation, but they have different eligibility requirements and offer different benefits. Asylum is available to those who fear persecution in their home country on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.

After the judge issues a decision, either party may reserve appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).

"
Q4: What is the role of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)?,"A4: The BIA is an administrative appellate body. If an appeal is filed with the BIA, the BIA's decision becomes the agency's final decision. So long as the appeal is pending with the Board, the immigration judge's decision is not final. An appeal must be filed within thirty days.

"
Q5: What happens in a master calendar hearing?,"A5: In the master calendar hearing, the judge will ask if the respondent has any relief from removal. The respondent must appear and answer the charges.

This can only be applied in limited circumstances, such as when a person at a port of entry does not have proper documentation or has committed fraud or falsely claimed U.S. citizenship.

"
Q2: Who has the authority to issue an order of expedited removal?,"A2: An officer of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to issue an order of expedited removal. Most often, officers within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issue these orders.

A court injunction has blocked an expansion of expedited removal to individuals who have been living in the United States for two years or less, and who live anywhere in the United States.

"
Q5: What is the role of asylum officers in the expedited removal process?,"A5: Noncitizens subject to expedited removal who indicate an intention to apply for asylum or who assert a fear of persecution or torture are to be interviewed by asylum officers. If these officers find that the noncitizens have a “credible fear,” they must be referred to an immigration judge.

"
Q1: What is the role of USCIS officers in the asylum claims process?,"A1: USCIS officers are trained specifically to adjudicate asylum claims. They review the claims of individuals subject to expedited removal who claim lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status or U. S. citizenship.

"
Q2: What is the process for juveniles in expedited removal proceedings?,"A2: Juveniles are not to be removed through this process. Instead, they should be served an NTA (Notice to Appear) and released into family care where possible.

"
Q3: What are the circumstances under which individuals in expedited removal proceedings can be paroled?,"A3: Individuals placed in expedited removal proceedings are not eligible for parole except in very limited circumstances, such as a matter of discretion for a medical emergency or for a law enforcement purpose.

"
Q5: What is the significance of the concept of admission in immigration law?,"A5: A key question in understanding what immigration laws will apply in a particular case is whether the person has been admitted into the United States. Depending on their current status in the United States, the immigrant will either be charged under the grounds of inadmissibility or the grounds of deportability.

"
Q1: What is the difference between inadmissibility and deportability?,"A1: Inadmissibility refers to the grounds on which a person can be denied entry into the United States, while deportability refers to the grounds on which a person who has already been admitted into the United States can be removed.

"

"
Q5: Under what circumstances is a lawful permanent resident considered an applicant for admission upon return from a trip abroad?,"A5: A lawful permanent resident is considered an applicant for admission upon return from a trip abroad under the circumstances described in INA § 101(a)(13)(C). These include having abandoned or relinquished that status, having been absent from the United States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days, having engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States, having departed from the United States while proceedings are pending, and having committed certain criminal offenses.

"
Q1: What are the six exceptions that will put lawful permanent residents in the same position as other noncitizens seeking admission?,"A1: The six exceptions are: 1) if they have abandoned or relinquished permanent resident status; 2) if they have been absent from the United States for a continuous period of more than 180 days; 3) if they have engaged in illegal activity after departing the United States; 4) if they have left the United States while under removal or extradition proceedings; 5) if they have committed an offense identified in INA § 212(a)(2) (grounds of inadmissibility relating to crimes), unless the person was granted INA § 212(h) relief or INA § 240A(a) cancellation of removal to forgive the offense; 6) if they are attempting to enter or has entered without inspection.

"
Q2: What is the significance of the INA § 101(a)(13) in relation to lawful permanent residents seeking admission?,"A2: INA § 101(a)(13) lists the circumstances that would make a lawful permanent resident an “applicant for admission.” If a resident's situation falls under any of these circumstances, they would be considered as ""seeking admission"" and would need to prove that they do not come within a ground of inadmissibility.

"
Q3: What happens if a lawful permanent resident is absent from the United States for more than 180 days?,"A3: If a lawful permanent resident is absent from the United States for more than 180 days, they will be considered as ""seeking admission"" under INA § 101(a)(13)(C)(ii). They can be placed in removal proceedings with a Notice to Appear and can be charged with being inadmissible.

"
Q4: What is the Fleuti exception?,"A4: The Fleuti exception is a limited exception for lawful permanent residents who were convicted of an offense described in INA § 101(a)(13)(C)(v) before April 1, 1997. The law before this date allowed lawful permanent residents to make “brief, casual, and innocent” departures without seeking a new admission to the United States.

"
Q5: What was the ruling in the Vartelas v. Holder case?,"A5: In the Vartelas v. Holder case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that INA § 101(a)(13)(C)(v) did not apply to lawful permanent residents with convictions that pre-dated April 1, 1997. These residents are not considered to be making a new admission upon return to the U.S. as long as the departure was “brief, casual, and innocent.”

"
"Q1: What is the significance of the date April 1, 1997 in the context of immigration law?","A1: April 1, 1997 is the date when the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) came into effect. This act introduced new rules governing when a lawful permanent resident returning from a trip abroad is considered to be seeking admission.

"
Q2: What is the Fleuti doctrine?,"A2: The Fleuti doctrine, established by the Supreme Court in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, states that permanent residents can rebut the presumption that they are making an entry upon return from a trip abroad if they establish that the trip was brief, casual, and innocent and not a meaningful departure interrupting their residency.

"
"Q3: How does the Fleuti doctrine apply to lawful permanent residents who were convicted by plea before April 1, 1997?","A3: The Fleuti doctrine applies to a lawful permanent resident who is charged with making a new “admission” upon return to the U.S. now, based on a conviction by plea from before April 1, 1997. Those who pled guilty before that date, traveled, and then sought to re-enter the United States after that date should still benefit from the Fleuti doctrine and not be considered as applicants for admission.

"
Q4: What are the six exceptions to the presumption that returning lawful permanent residents are not seeking admission?,"A4: The text does not provide the specific six exceptions. However, it mentions that these exceptions do not look exclusively at the character of the absence, but also look to bad behavior on the part of the resident.

"
Q5: How does inadmissibility impact a lawful permanent resident while they are in the U.S.?,"A5: Inadmissibility does not impact a lawful permanent resident while they are in the U.S. For example, if a lawful permanent resident commits a crime that would make them inadmissible, they are not deportable for this one offense and are not subject to removal as long as they remain in the U.S.

"
Q1: What is the impact of a crime on an immigrant's admissibility under INA § 101(a)(13)?,"A1: If an immigrant has committed a crime that makes them inadmissible, they are considered to be seeking an admission if they travel outside the U.S. and can be placed in removal proceedings as an arriving alien, subject to grounds of inadmissibility.

"
Q2: What is the Fleuti exception in relation to INA § 101(a)(13)?,"A2: The Fleuti exception applies where the returning resident has been convicted of an offense triggering inadmissibility prior to April 1, 1997. They can argue that their trip was brief, casual, and innocent, and thus they are not subject to INA § 101(a)(13). This exception does not apply to LPRs who are found to be seeking admission for other reasons, such as a trip over 180 days, or subject to non-crime-based grounds of inadmissibility.

"
Q3: How does a false admission as a U.S. citizen compare to admission on a fraudulent visa?,"A3: A noncitizen who gains admission to the U.S. by pretending to be a U.S. citizen has not been “admitted,” because they were not admitted and inspected as an alien. However, a noncitizen who has used a fraudulent visa has been admitted, even though the admission was not lawful.

"
"Q4: What is the definition of ""admission"" under INA § 101(a)(13)(A)?","A4: The definition of ""admission"" under INA § 101(a)(13)(A) requires ""procedural regularity."" This means that someone who enters fraudulently using another’s permanent resident card or other false document is considered admitted for purposes of adjusting status to lawful permanent resident under INA § 245(a).

"
Q5: What are the special considerations for undocumented individuals in removal proceedings?,"A5: Undocumented individuals in the U.S. could have either been admitted at the border or entered without inspection, and therefore not previously admitted. Those who entered with a proper visa but overstayed their authorized period of stay will be charged under the grounds of deportability. Those who entered the U.S. in some way other than through a check point will be charged under the grounds of inadmissibility.

"
Q1: What is the main concern once a person faces removal proceedings?,"A1: The main concern becomes eligibility for relief because the fact they have no status means the government will likely prevail on a charge of removability based on having no status.

"
Q2: What are the various forms of immigration relief?,"A2: These are applications a person can file to gain status or the right to stay in the United States. Each application has its own eligibility criteria.

"
Q3: What is the difference between deportation and exclusion proceedings before IIRIRA?,"A3: Before IIRIRA, whether the person faced the grounds of deportation or exclusion depended on whether the person made an entry into the United States, not whether the person was admitted. An entry includes a person coming into the United States legally or illegally, with or without inspection.

"
Q4: What is the difference between entry and admission?,"A4: An entry includes a person coming into the United States legally or illegally, with or without inspection. An admission is an entry after DHS inspection.

"
Q5: How did IIRIRA change what happens to people who entered without inspection?,"A5: Before IIRIRA, those people had an advantage: because they had made an entry, the former INS had to prove that they were deportable. Under current removal proceedings, people who enter without inspection have a disadvantage: since they have not been inspected, they are considered to still be seeking admission, even if they have lived in the United States for years.

"
Q1: What are the grounds of inadmissibility and how do they differ from grounds of exclusion?,"A1: The grounds of inadmissibility are reasons an alien can be refused admission to and/or removed from the United States. They include health-related concerns, criminal grounds, lying to government officials to gain a benefit, risk they will become dependent on government welfare programs, unlawful presence in the United States, terrorism, and certain crimes. The terms ""grounds of inadmissibility"" and ""grounds of exclusion"" are essentially the same and are used interchangeably. The term ""grounds of exclusion"" was used in pre-IIRIRA law.

"
Q2: What are the grounds of deportability?,"A2: The grounds of deportability are reasons that an alien, who has been admitted, can be removed from the United States. These grounds include certain crimes, including aggravated felonies, terrorism, and violating immigration laws, such as overstaying a visa.

"
Q3: Who has the burden of proof in deportation and exclusion hearings?,"A3: In deportation hearings, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has the burden of proving the person is deportable. In exclusion hearings, the person has to prove that they are admissible.

"
Q4: What is an Order to Show Cause (OSC)?,"A4: An Order to Show Cause (OSC) is a document that a person in deportation proceedings will have received. It is a formal court order that requires the recipient to appear in court and explain why they should not be deported.

"
Q5: What is the relevance of the grounds of inadmissibility in immigration applications?,"A5: The grounds of inadmissibility are relevant requirements to establish eligibility for many immigration applications, including adjustment of status, registry, the old amnesty programs, Temporary Protected States (TPS), and nonimmigrant visas.

"
Q1: What is the importance of understanding the wording of the statute in removal defense?,"A1: Understanding the wording of the statute is important because it can help form your own understanding about what the statute says and you might find arguments by thinking about the wording of the actual statute. Interpretation of the statute is also informed by case law and agency regulations.

"
Q2: Who bears the burden of proof of alienage?,"A2: The burden of proof of alienage falls on the government. For noncitizens found within the United States without being admitted or paroled, the government must prove their alienage.

"
Q3: What happens once alienage has been established?,"A3: Once alienage has been established, the noncitizen must prove by clear and convincing evidence that they are lawfully in the U.S. pursuant to a prior admission or are clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the U.S. and are not inadmissible as charged. For noncitizens in removal proceedings, once alienage has been established, the burden of proof shifts to the noncitizen to show the time, place, and manner of entry.

"
Q4: Who bears the burden of proof under the inadmissibility grounds in INA § 212(a)?,"A4: Under INA § 240(c)(2), noncitizens who are subject to the grounds of inadmissibility, which includes those who are applying for adjustment of status under Section 245, bear the burden of proving either: 1. that they are “clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and not inadmissible under section 212 ” or, 2. by clear and convincing evidence, that they are lawfully present in the U.S. pursuant to a prior admission.

"
Q5: Can the information in an application for relief from removal be held to be an admission of alienage?,"A5: No, even if the person has submitted an application for relief from removal, the information in that application cannot be held to be an admission of alienage.

"
Q1: Who bears the burden of proof in removal proceedings where a lawful permanent resident is charged with a ground of inadmissibility as an arriving alien?,"A1: The government bears the burden of proof in removal proceedings where a lawful permanent resident is charged with a ground of inadmissibility as an arriving alien.

"
Q2: What rights do lawful permanent residents have when returning from a trip abroad according to the U.S. Supreme Court?,"A2: Lawful permanent residents returning from a trip abroad are entitled to due process protections, meaning that they have the right to a full and fair hearing and the right to confront the evidence against them.

"
Q3: Who bears the burden of proof under the deportability grounds in INA § 237?,"A3: For noncitizens who are subject to the grounds of deportability, the government bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the noncitizen is deportable.

"
"Q4: What is the standard for proving deportability according to the Supreme Court case, Woodby v. INS?","A4: The standard for proving deportability was deemed to be clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.

"
Q5: What happens if the government has made a prima facie case for deportability according to Matter of Vivas?,"A5: If the government has made a prima facie case for deportability, the noncitizen may be required to submit evidence that rebuts the government’s case if the evidence in question is within the noncitizen’s knowledge and control.

"
Q1: What is the burden of proof in a removal defense case?,"A1: The burden of proof in a removal defense case initially lies with the government to submit prima facie evidence of deportability. Once this is done, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent to rebut that evidence.

"
Q2: Can the government meet its burden of proof solely based on the respondent's assertion of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent?,"A2: No, the government cannot meet its burden of proof solely based on the respondent's assertion of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The government must have submitted clear and convincing, credible proof of deportability, which the noncitizen then has the burden of rebutting, before the noncitizen's silence can be used against him.

"
Q3: What is the conflict in the Circuit Courts regarding the standard for establishing deportability?,"A3: There is a conflict in the Circuit Courts over how the clear and convincing, or clear, unequivocal, and convincing standard for establishing deportability should be interpreted. The Eleventh Circuit and the Second Circuit have different interpretations of this standard.

"
Q4: What is the burden of proof in applications for discretionary relief from removal?,"A4: The burden of proof in applications for discretionary relief from removal is different from the burdens of proof for establishing deportability or inadmissibility. If the government successfully establishes deportability or inadmissibility for a lawful permanent resident, the next step is to determine if the client may be eligible for some form of relief from removal.

"
"Q5: What is the significance of the cases Matter of Guevara, Adefemi v. Ashcroft, and Francis v. Gonzales in the context of removal defense?","A5: These cases are significant as they provide precedent for the burden of proof in removal defense cases. Matter of Guevara affirmed that the government cannot meet its burden of proof solely based on the respondent's silence. Adefemi v. Ashcroft and Francis v. Gonzales represent the conflict in the Circuit Courts over how the clear and convincing standard for establishing deportability should be interpreted.

"
Q1: What is the burden of proof for an alien applying for relief or protection from removal according to INA § 240(c)(4)(A)?,"A1: The alien has the burden of proof to establish that they satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements and, for any form of relief that is granted in the exercise of discretion, that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion. They must also submit information or documentation to support the application, as required by law, regulation, or the instructions in the application form.

"
Q2: What is the requirement for providing evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony?,"A2: The evidence must be provided unless the applicant shows they do not have it and cannot reasonably obtain it.

"
Q3: What is the burden of proof for a noncitizen according to 8 CFR § 1240.8(d)?,"A3: The noncitizen has the burden of establishing that they are eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.

"
Q4: What is the issue with a vague record of conviction in the context of applications for relief from removal?,"A4: Courts are conflicted on whether an applicant for a benefit can meet their burden of proof when the record of conviction is vague. This becomes an issue for those that have been convicted of a “divisible” statute, but the record relating to that conviction does not specify which piece of the divisible statute they violated.

"
Q5: What is an example of a divisible statute and how does it affect the burden of proof?,"A5: An example of divisible statutes are California drug statutes. They are divisible between the different substances— some of which are substances that also are on federal drug schedules (e.g., like ecstasy or methamphetamine), which would be a controlled substance conviction for immigration purposes, and some of which only appear on California drug schedules (e.g., chorionic gonadotropin), which would not trigger a ground of removal under our federal immigration law. If a person’s record of conviction is vague and just says “a controlled substance”, it can be difficult to determine whether they meet their burden of proof.

"
Q1: What was the ruling in Young v. Holder?,"A1: The Young v. Holder ruling stated that a vague record of conviction is not enough to establish eligibility for relief where the conviction raises a potential bar. Respondents bear the burden of proving that a conviction does not trigger deportability or inadmissibility which would disqualify the noncitizen from eligibility for relief from removal.

"
Q2: What change did Marinelarena v. Barr bring about?,"A2: Marinelarena v. Barr overruled the prior decision in Young v. Holder. It holds that a vague record is sufficient for a person applying for relief to show that they have met their burden of proof.
