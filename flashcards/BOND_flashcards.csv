Q1: What is a bond in the context of immigration law?,"A1: A bond is not a fine. It is a guarantee to the government that, if you are let out of detention, you will go to all of your hearings and will obey the judge's order at the end of the case.

If you lose your case, you must report to DHS or you will not get the bond money back.

"
