"
Q4: What should you do if the interpreter makes a mistake during your asylum interview?,"A4: If the interpreter does not translate properly and the officer assumes that you caused the mistakes or errors, you should correct it immediately.

"
Q2: What should you consider about the government's involvement in your persecution?,"A2: You should consider how the government in your country was involved. If the government itself did not harm, persecute, or torture you, what did the government of your country – including the police – try to do about it? You should be able to prove that the government of your country, including the local authorities, were either unwilling or unable to protect you.

"
Q3: What should you be able to show if you tried to go somewhere else in your country?,"A3: You should be able to show that if you tried to go somewhere else in your country, the people who harmed you (or who want to harm you) are still there and still want to harm you, the people who will harm you will find you wherever you go, or it would be unreasonable for you to go anywhere else, maybe because you would be at great risk of harm in general.

"
Q4: What happens after your interview for asylum?,"A4: In the days after your interview, the asylum officer will decide if your fear is credible or reasonable and if you should be able to apply for asylum before the immigration judge.

Q1: What happens in a reasonable fear interview for people who have been deported before or have an aggravated felony?,"A1: In a reasonable fear interview, the asylum officer will summarize the facts of the interview and will usually ask if the summary is accurate. It is important to correct any inaccuracies in the written summary.

"
Q2: What does it mean if you pass your interview?,"A2: If you pass your interview, it does not mean that you have won your case. It only means that you will have the opportunity to see an immigration judge to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or Convention Against Torture protection and tell your story.

"
Q3: What can you do if you do not pass your interview?,"A3: If you do not pass your interview, you can ask the immigration judge to review the asylum officer’s decision. However, it is generally very difficult to get these decisions overturned.
