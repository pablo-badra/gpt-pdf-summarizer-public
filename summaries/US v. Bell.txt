The case U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986) revolves around Bruce Bell's appeal against the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas' decision to revoke his probation for violating state and federal laws. The court allowed the presentation of urinalysis lab reports and police reports at the probation revocation hearing without requiring the presence of those who prepared them, but did not admit hearsay testimony from the supervising probation officer.

Bell's probation period began in December 1983 after serving time in prison and a halfway house, followed by parole. In March 1985, due to alleged violations including positive THC urine tests and an arrest for driving while intoxicated and possession charges, the government petitioned for revocation of Bell's probation. At this hearing, lab reports analyzing Bell's urine samples and police reports detailing his arrest were presented as evidence.

The court had to balance Bell's right to confront witnesses against him with the government’s reasons for not requiring confrontation. The government was required to show "good cause" for not necessitating confrontation which involved evaluating factors such as why confrontation is undesirable or impractical, and how reliable is the evidence offered instead of live testimony. The court concluded that good cause was shown for admitting laboratory and police reports but not concerning suspicions about Bell being involved again in cocaine sales by Arkansas State Police.

Finally, despite acknowledging potential inconvenience in requiring Kansas officers to testify personally, their accounts were deemed reliable due to corroborations from Bell’s own admissions about drinking alcohol and driving without lights at night. However, David Lehren’s testimony based on conversations with investigating officers was considered unreliable “double hearsay” leading to a violation of Bell’s Sixth Amendment rights.

Summary: 
The case U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986) involves Bruce Bell, who appealed the decision of the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas to revoke his probation for violating state and federal laws. Bell was convicted in 1980 for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and for using the telephone to facilitate the conspiracy. The Court of Appeals held that good cause was shown for allowing the state to present urinalysis lab reports and police reports at the probation revocation hearing without producing the persons who prepared them. However, it also held that good cause was not shown for admitting hearsay testimony of the supervising probation officer. The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for further proceedings.

- The procedural history of the case includes Bell's initial conviction in 1980 for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and for using the telephone to facilitate the conspiracy.

Summary: 
The case U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986) continues with Bruce Bell's probation period, which began in December 1983 after he served 20 months in prison and a halfway house and completed 16 months of parole. Bell was required to obey all local, state, and federal laws as a condition of his probation. However, in March 1985, the government petitioned for revocation of Bell's probation, alleging that Bell had violated this provision. The petition cited three instances where Bell's urine samples tested positive for THC, indicating marijuana use, and an arrest in February 1985 for driving while intoxicated, possession of marijuana, and possession of narcotic paraphernalia. At the revocation hearing, the government presented two witnesses and introduced reports from the lab that analyzed Bell's urine and police reports of Bell's arrest. Bell argued that his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him was violated by the introduction of these reports and the testimony about the suspicions of the Arkansas State Police that Bell was again involved in cocaine sales.

Summary: 
The case U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986) continues with the court's decision on the admissibility of the evidence presented against Bell. The court must balance the probationer's right to confront a witness against the government's reasons for not requiring confrontation. The government must show "good cause" for not requiring confrontation, which can be determined by evaluating several factors. These include the government's explanation for why confrontation is undesirable or impractical, and the reliability of the evidence offered in place of live testimony. The court concluded that the government met the good cause requirement for the laboratory and police reports, but not for the testimony concerning the Arkansas State Police investigation. The urinalysis laboratory reports were deemed reliable, but the police reports were considered less reliable due to their subjective nature. The court noted that the officers who arrested Bell could have been called to testify in person.

- The procedural history of the case includes Bell's initial conviction in 1980, his probation period that began in December 1983, the government's petition in March 1985 for revocation of Bell's probation due to alleged violations, and the District Court's revocation of Bell's probation after a hearing in May 1985. This text fragment focuses on the court's decision regarding the admissibility of the evidence presented against Bell.
- Law enforcement reports, including urinalysis lab reports and police reports of Bell's arrest, were admitted during the revocation hearing. The court assigned significant weight to the urinalysis lab reports, deeming them reliable. However, the police reports were considered less reliable due to their subjective nature. The court noted that the officers who arrested Bell could have been called to testify in person, suggesting that the police reports were not given as much weight as the lab reports.

Summary: 
The court in U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986) further deliberates on the admissibility of the Kansas police reports and the testimony about an Arkansas State Police investigation. The court acknowledges the potential expense and inconvenience of requiring the Kansas officers to testify in person. However, it concludes that Bell's own admissions corroborate the police reports, making them reliable. Bell admitted to driving without lights at night and drinking, which supports the officers' account. Therefore, the court finds that the District Court was justified in accepting the police reports without requiring the officers' personal presence. However, the court finds David Lehren's testimony about an Arkansas State Police investigation into Bell's alleged cocaine trafficking unreliable. Lehren's account was based on conversations with the investigating officers and an FBI agent, constituting "double hearsay." The court concludes that the District Court violated Bell's Sixth Amendment right by relying on Lehren's testimony and remands the case for reconsideration without considering this testimony.

- The procedural history of the case continues with the court's decision on the admissibility of the Kansas police reports and the testimony about an Arkansas State Police investigation. The court finds the police reports reliable due to Bell's admissions, but deems Lehren's testimony unreliable. The case is remanded for reconsideration without considering Lehren's testimony.
- The Kansas police reports were admitted during the proceedings. The court assigned significant weight to these reports due to Bell's admissions, which corroborated the officers' account. However, Lehren's testimony about an Arkansas State Police investigation was also admitted but was later deemed unreliable and in violation of Bell's Sixth Amendment right. The court did not assign any weight to this testimony and remanded the case for reconsideration without considering it.

Summary: 
In U.S. v. Bell, 785 F.2d 640 (1986), the court decides to revoke Bell's probation based solely on the violations established by the laboratory and arrest reports, disregarding any suspicions of cocaine dealing raised by David Lehren's cross-examination. The court instructs that if the District Court reaffirms its earlier decision, the judgment revoking probation will stand affirmed. The court also addresses Bell's challenge to the accuracy of the laboratory reports and his argument that the use of arrest reports violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court rejects these arguments, stating that the government established a violation of law, making it unnecessary to show that Bell had been convicted of that violation in a separate criminal prosecution.

- The procedural history of the case includes the court's decision to revoke Bell's probation based on the laboratory and arrest reports, disregarding any suspicions of cocaine dealing raised by David Lehren's cross-examination. The case is vacated and remanded with instructions.
- The laboratory and arrest reports were admitted during the proceedings. The court assigned significant weight to these reports, basing its decision to revoke Bell's probation on them.
