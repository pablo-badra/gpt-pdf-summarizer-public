The case U.S. v. Johnson, 710 F.3d 784 (2013) revolves around Ricky Lee Johnson's appeal against a judgment from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, which revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 21 months' imprisonment. The main contention was that Johnson's due process rights were violated when a police report was read into evidence by a probation officer during his revocation hearing without giving him an opportunity to question adverse witnesses.

Johnson had been convicted in 2007 for conspiracy to possess stolen mail and began his supervised release in 2009. During this period, he was alleged to have committed several violations including second-degree forgery and theft of property, failing a drug test, and leaving a rehabilitation facility prematurely. At his revocation hearing, he admitted to some violations but refused to admit the pending state charges.

The government argued that any error in admitting the police report during Johnson's revocation hearing was harmless as they could subpoena the arresting officers to testify in line with the report. However, it wasn't certain if their testimonies would align with the report until cross-examined. The court found that while rules of evidence do not apply at revocation hearings, defendants are entitled to question any adverse witness unless it is determined unnecessary for justice.

The court concluded that relying solely on a police report as evidence of criminal conduct is insufficiently reliable when no explanation is provided for why live testimony isn't available from relevant law enforcement officers. It also ruled that new evidence should not be allowed on remand if it wasn't presented at initial sentencing.

- Procedural history: 
    - In 2007, Johnson was convicted for conspiracy to possess stolen mail.
    - He began supervised release in 2009.
    - During this period, allegations arose leading to filing of Petition for Warrant for Offender Under Supervision.
    - At his revocation hearing where he admitted some violations but denied others; he was sentenced again.
    - He appealed this decision arguing violation of due process rights because a police report was used as evidence without allowing him confrontation with adverse witnesses.
    - The court agreed with Johnson vacating his sentence and remanding the case back down.

- Law enforcement reports:
   - A police report was read into evidence during revocation hearing by probation officer.
   - This played significant role influencing decision against Johnson despite objections raised by defense counsel about violation of due process rights.
   - On appeal however, court found use of such reports unreliable especially without provision for live testimony or valid reasons explaining unavailability thereof.
   - Court ruled out possibility of introducing new evidences on remand if they weren't presented initially at sentencing stage

Summary: 
The case U.S. v. Johnson, 710 F.3d 784 (2013) was heard in the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. The defendant, Ricky Lee Johnson, appealed against a judgment from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, which revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 21 months' imprisonment. Johnson argued that his due process rights were violated when a police report was read into evidence by a probation officer during his revocation hearing, as he was not given the opportunity to question adverse witnesses. The Court of Appeals agreed with Johnson, vacating his sentence and remanding the case.

- Procedural history: Johnson was initially found to have violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release during a revocation hearing in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. He was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment. Johnson appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.
- Law enforcement reports were admitted during the revocation hearing. A police report was read into evidence by a probation officer. The court did not specify the weight or importance assigned to this report.

Summary: 
The case U.S. v. Johnson, 710 F.3d 784 (2013) continued with the revelation that Johnson was convicted in 2007 for conspiracy to possess stolen mail and was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release. His supervised release began in 2009. The probation office filed a Petition for Warrant for Offender Under Supervision, alleging Johnson had been arrested for second-degree forgery and theft of property, failed a drug test, and failed to complete drug treatment. During his revocation hearing, Johnson admitted to leaving a rehabilitation facility and testing positive for marijuana but refused to admit to the pending state charges. The government's attorney suggested that the probation officer could read from the police report to prove the allegations. Johnson's attorney objected, arguing that this violated Johnson's right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. The district court overruled the objection, stating that the rules of evidence are relaxed in a revocation hearing. The probation officer read the police report into the record, and the court found that Johnson violated his supervised release by violating a state law and sentenced him to twenty-one months imprisonment with an additional three-year supervised release term. Johnson's attorney renewed the objection to the police report, and Johnson appealed the district court's judgment.

Summary: 
The government argued that any error in admitting the police report during Johnson's revocation hearing was harmless, as they could simply subpoena the arresting officers to testify in line with the report. However, the court noted that it was not certain that the officers would testify consistently with the report until they were cross-examined. The government also claimed that Johnson did not raise the due process issue in the district court, but the court found that Johnson's attorney had preserved the due process issue for appeal. The attorney had objected to a separate constitutional violation of Johnson's right to cross-examine an adverse witness and had made specific and timely objections throughout the hearing. Regarding the merits of Johnson's argument, the court noted that while a defendant is not entitled to a trial during a revocation hearing and the rules of evidence do not apply, a defendant is entitled to question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.

Summary: 
The court discusses the requirements for a defendant's right to confront an adverse witness during a revocation hearing, as outlined in Morrissey v. Brewer and United States v. Bell. The court should balance the defendant's right to confront a witness against the government's reasons for not requiring confrontation. The court should consider the government's explanation for why confrontation is undesirable or impractical and the reliability of the evidence the government offers in place of live testimony. The court addresses the issue of whether a police report alone is sufficiently reliable evidence of criminal conduct when the government offers no explanation for the arresting officer's unavailability. The court finds that the police report is not sufficiently reliable, especially since the government provided no explanation for why the arresting officer did not testify at Johnson's hearing. The court concludes that the district court erred in not allowing Johnson to confront an adverse witness and in considering the facts contained in the police report. The court also discusses whether the record should be reopened on remand, noting that the consensus among other circuits is that the government should not be allowed to enter new evidence on remand if it failed to present evidence at the initial sentencing.

Summary: 
The court discusses the government's failure to adequately prove the additional allegations of second-degree forgery and theft of property against Johnson. The government's attorneys admitted they had no witnesses and could only rely on the police report of the April 12th violation. Johnson's attorney objected to the probation officer merely reading the arrest report into evidence, arguing it violated a constitutional right. The court concluded that the government had a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence and should not be allowed another chance. The court vacated Johnson's sentence and remanded the case to the district court for re-sentencing based on the existing record, without considering the contents of the police report detailing the April 12, 2012, conduct.

Summary: 
The court discusses the nature of Johnson's admission to possessing a Schedule IV substance, which is classified as a Class A misdemeanor. This classification does not exceed one year of imprisonment. The government did not attempt to prove that Johnson possessed methamphetamine nor did it introduce any evidence that Johnson possessed more than 28 grams of marijuana. Therefore, Johnson's admission would only qualify as a misdemeanor, specifically a Grade C violation according to the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual.
