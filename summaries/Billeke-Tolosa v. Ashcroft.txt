The case Billeke-Tolosa v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 708 (2004) involves an appeal by Sergio Waldmir Billeke-Tolosa against the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision to deny his petition for adjustment of status due to allegations of sexual misconduct involving young girls. The Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction to consider the nondiscretionary basis for the BIA's discretionary decision and found that the BIA had improperly considered unproven allegations against Billeke-Tolosa in denying him relief.

Billeke-Tolosa, a native of Chile, arrived in the U.S. on a student visa in 1990 and later violated the terms of his visa. He conceded his deportability but requested an adjustment of status to remain in the U.S with his American wife. His criminal history, which included traffic offenses and two accusations of sexual misconduct involving young girls, was heavily scrutinized during these proceedings.

In appealing the IJ's decision, Billeke-Tolosa argued that unproven allegations were wrongly considered as part of his case - a violation of BIA precedent according to him. The court agreed with this argument stating that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations and precedents and concluded that ignoring its own procedural rules was not harmless error on part of the BIA.

Finally, it was determined by the court that there was substantial prejudice against Billeke-Tolosa due to failure from BIA's side to follow its own precedent since there was no independent evidence supporting allegations against him apart from unproven ones. As such, they vacated deportation order and remanded case for further consideration.

- Procedural history includes: arrival in US on student visa; violation of visa terms; concession of deportability; request for adjustment status; denial by IJ based on criminal history including accusations related to sexual misconduct; affirmation by BIA without opinion; appeal arguing wrongful consideration unproven allegations violating precedent.
- Law enforcement reports were not explicitly mentioned as being admitted during immigration proceedings.
- However, given significant influence exerted by criminal history including accusations related sexual misconduct over IJ's decision suggests possible use law enforcement reports.
- Court found improper weightage given unproven allegations absence independent evidence or convictions suggesting undue importance assigned them during proceedings leading prejudicial treatment towards appellant.

Summary: 
Billeke-Tolosa, a native of Chile, arrived in the U.S. on a student visa in 1990. He later retired from his studies, violating the terms of his visa. The Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a show cause notice in 1995, and Billeke-Tolosa conceded his deportability in a 1997 hearing, but requested an adjustment of status to remain in the U.S. with his American wife. The hearing on his request began in 2000, focusing on his criminal history, which included traffic offenses and two accusations of sexual misconduct involving young girls. Billeke-Tolosa denied the charges, attributing them to personal disputes, and pled guilty to lesser charges in both instances. The IJ appointed a licensed clinical social worker to evaluate Billeke-Tolosa, who concluded he was not a pedophile. Despite this, the IJ denied the adjustment of status, focusing on the convictions related to improper interactions with young girls. The IJ ordered Billeke-Tolosa removed, and the BIA affirmed without opinion.

- The procedural history of the case includes Billeke-Tolosa's arrival in the U.S. on a student visa, his violation of the visa terms, his concession of deportability, and his request for an adjustment of status. The focus of the proceedings was his criminal history, particularly the accusations of sexual misconduct. The IJ denied the adjustment of status and ordered Billeke-Tolosa removed, a decision affirmed by the BIA.
- The text does not explicitly state whether law enforcement reports were admitted during the immigration proceedings. However, the IJ's decision was heavily influenced by Billeke-Tolosa's criminal history, including the accusations of sexual misconduct and his subsequent convictions for lesser charges. The IJ also considered the evaluation by a licensed clinical social worker. The weight given to these elements suggests that they played a significant role in the proceedings.

Summary: 
Billeke-Tolosa appealed the IJ's decision, arguing that the IJ wrongly considered unproven allegations that did not result in convictions, which he claimed was a violation of BIA precedent. The government argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary denial of a request for status adjustment. However, Billeke-Tolosa was not challenging the IJ's discretion, but rather the legal error made during the exercise of that discretion. The court decided that it could review non-discretionary decisions that underlie determinations that are ultimately discretionary. Billeke-Tolosa claimed that the BIA ignored its precedential case law. The court noted that agencies are bound to follow their own regulations and precedents, and the BIA's consistent application of its precedents serves to provide fair notice to those subject to its decisions.

Summary: 
The court further elaborated on Billeke-Tolosa's appeal, stating that the BIA had no discretion to ignore its own precedent. Billeke-Tolosa argued that the IJ's consideration of unproven allegations of sexual misconduct contravened the BIA's resolution of In re Catalina Arreguin De Rodriguez. In that case, the BIA had given little weight to an arrest report without a conviction or corroborating evidence. The court found the facts in Billeke-Tolosa's case to be materially the same, suggesting that the IJ erred. The government argued that the cases were different for three reasons, but the court dismissed each argument. The court concluded that the BIA's failure to follow its own procedural rules was not harmless error.

Summary: 
The court found that the BIA's failure to follow its own precedent resulted in substantial prejudice against Billeke-Tolosa. There was no independent evidence supporting the allegations against him. A court-retained social worker, Shoun, concluded that Billeke-Tolosa likely did not commit the offenses and was not a pedophile. Billeke-Tolosa's sentence for disorderly conduct was suspended as the court determined he was unlikely to engage in criminal conduct again. The IJ's concerns about Billeke-Tolosa's sexual conduct were the primary reason for denying his petition for adjusted status. The IJ acknowledged Billeke-Tolosa's positive contributions and stable life but was influenced by the unproven allegations. The court concluded that the IJ's consideration of these factors was prejudicial. The deportation order was vacated and the case was remanded for further consideration.
